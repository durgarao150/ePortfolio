            <h3>Solar System Quiz App</h3>
            <p>
                The Solar System Quiz App is an engaging and educational tool designed to test and enhance users' knowledge about planets, moons, and other celestial objects. This interactive app is perfect for anyone curious about astronomy, offering a fun and accessible way to explore the wonders of our solar system.            </p>
            <p>
                To make the learning experience more enjoyable, the quiz interface underwent a complete redesign focused on improving usability and engagement. Dropdown menus were replaced with vibrant, interactive buttons to create a dynamic and user-friendly experience. Each button features polished borders, box-shadow effects, and hover animations, adding a sleek, modern touch to the design. Additionally, users receive clear visual feedback during the quiz: selected options are highlighted in light blue for better visibility, correct answers are shown in green, and incorrect answers turn red to provide instant clarity. These updates enhance the app's overall functionality and aesthetic appeal.
            </p>
            <p>This project demonstrates the potential of combining education with technology to make learning both effective and enjoyable.</p>

                Key updates to the project focused on enhancing both functionality and visual design. A redesigned header was added to create a professional and welcoming introduction to the page. Expanded content provides users with additional context and instructions, making the activity more informative and accessible.
