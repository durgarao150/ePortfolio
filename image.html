        <h2>Book Cover Design</h2>

        <p>
          The book cover for <em>Always Seeking Amazing Places</em> was designed using Canva, blending a mountain
          landscape with a painted sky to create a cohesive and natural scene. Transparency adjustments were carefully
          applied to seamlessly merge the sky with the mountains and water, enhancing the visual harmony. Additional
          elements, including the silhouette of a man at the water’s edge, birds flying overhead, and a tree in the
          background, were strategically placed to balance the composition. Shadows were added to provide depth and
          integrate these elements into the scene naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          To highlight the traveler as the focal point, the silhouette was slightly darkened against the warm tones of the
          vibrant sky. For the title, the Quotes Script Painter font was used to create a personal, handwritten feel that
          complements the adventurous theme of the book. Black and white text ensured high readability and contrasted
          effectively with the colorful background without disrupting the visual flow. The overall design evokes a serene
          yet adventurous atmosphere, perfectly capturing the essence of exploration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Logo Design</h2>
        <img src="resources/logo.png" alt="Logo Placeholder" class="logo">
        <p>
          The logo for <em>Always Seeking Amazing Places</em> (ASAP) was also designed in Canva, focusing on minimalism
          and symbolic elements. A compass was crafted using four triangles representing cardinal directions, giving the
          logo a clean and modern appearance. This was complemented by geometric tree shapes, also made from triangles,
          to introduce a natural element symbolizing exploration and the outdoors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bold, modern typography was chosen for “ASAP,” ensuring clarity and seamless integration with the geometric
          elements. The layout was carefully designed to maintain balance and versatility, making it suitable for various
          platforms such as websites, social media, and printed materials. Earthy tones were used to create a calm and
          timeless aesthetic that reflects the brand's connection to nature and adventure.

      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Both the book cover and logo share a cohesive visual language, emphasizing simplicity, balance, and clarity.
          Thoughtful techniques, such as blending transparency, applying shadows, and ensuring symmetry, were used to
          unify the elements. The book cover captures the serenity and excitement of exploration, while the logo embodies
          travel and adventure through clean and symbolic design. Together, these designs create a professional and
          visually engaging representation of <em>Always Seeking Amazing Places</em>, suitable for a variety of
          applications.
