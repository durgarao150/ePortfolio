            <h3>Video Design Process</h3>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
                <li><strong>Image Selection and Editing:</strong> High-quality images were carefully curated for each stage of the butterfly's life cycle. These visuals were resized, cropped, and formatted to maintain consistency throughout the video and ensure a smooth flow between segments. Color adjustments were made to enhance clarity and vibrancy.</li>
                <li><strong>Transitions:</strong> A variety of transition effects, including dissolve, slide, wipe, and fade, were used strategically to maintain viewer interest. Major transitions, such as moving from the caterpillar to the chrysalis stage, were emphasized using fade effects to highlight the significance of these milestones in the butterfly's life cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Captions:</strong> Closed captions were incorporated to label each stage clearly, guiding viewers through the journey. Descriptive captions provided brief yet informative details about what occurs during each phase, enriching the educational value of the video.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio:</strong> To enhance the immersive experience, a calming background soundtrack was added from iMovie’s extensive library. The audio track was carefully synchronized with the visuals to create a cohesive viewing experience. Additionally, a narration track was included, explaining the transformation process and offering intriguing facts about butterflies.</li>
                <li><strong>Intro and Outro:</strong> The video begins and ends with polished thematic sequences, crafted using fade and theme transitions. These elements create a professional opening and closing, ensuring the video feels complete and well-rounded.</li>
            </ul>
