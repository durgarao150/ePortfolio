                The demonstration walks viewers through practical steps, starting with initializing a Git repository. It explains how to stage changes using git add, commit them with meaningful messages using git commit, and push them to a remote repository using git push. Each step is clearly demonstrated, ensuring that viewers can understand and replicate the process in their projects.

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The video creation process involved capturing screen actions, editing, and adding visual enhancements for clarity and engagement:
            </p>
            <ul class="spaced-list">
                <li><strong>Capturing:</strong> The Snipping Tool was used to record screen actions, ensuring smooth and accurate transitions between the various steps in the Git workflow. This helped create a seamless flow of actions for viewers to follow easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Editing:</strong> The captured clips were imported into Clipchamp, where they were edited to refine transitions and remove unnecessary pauses. Audio narration was recorded and synced with the visual timeline, providing clear instructions to guide viewers through each step of the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Enhancements:</strong> To highlight key actions and areas of focus, additional shapes like arrows, rectangles, and text labels were added using iMovie. These enhancements made the video more visually engaging and ensured that viewers could quickly identify important details.</li>
            </ul>
